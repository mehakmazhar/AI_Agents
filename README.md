# AI_Agents
An intelligent agent (IA) is an entity that makes a decision that enables artificial intelligence to be put into action. It can also be described as a software entity that conducts operations in the place of users or programs after sensing the environment. It uses actuators to initiate action in that environment.

# How intelligent agents work
Intelligent agents work through three main components: sensors, actuators, and
effectors. Getting an overview of these components can improve our understanding of
how intelligent agents work.
**Sensors**: These are devices that detect any changes in the environment. This
information is sent to other devices. In artificial intelligence, the environment of
the system is observed by intelligent agents through sensors.
**Actuators:** These are components through which energy is converted into
motion. They perform the role of controlling and moving a system. Examples
include rails, motors, and gears.
**Effectors:** The environment is affected by effectors. Examples include legs,
fingers, wheels, display screen, and arms.
